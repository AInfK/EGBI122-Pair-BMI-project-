## 1) Executive Summary

This project is a three-tab, in-memory health calculator built with **Python**, **Gradio 5.49**, and **Matplotlib**. It helps track **BMI**, estimate **BMR/TDEE** (Harris‚ÄìBenedict + activity factors), and log daily calories via a **Food Tracker** with a goal-based target line and a **7-day chart**. I designed it with strict input guardrails (one BMI per day, range checks, confirmation for outliers) to reduce data entry errors, which is important for biomedical data quality.

Use cases include personal health tracking, demonstrating basic biomedical calculations, and practicing UI/UX for health tools.

## 2) Learning Objectives

1. Implement biomedical formulas (BMI, BMR/TDEE) correctly in Python.
2. Enforce data integrity (single daily records, numeric checks, range validation).
3. Build a usable health UI with clear feedback and plots for trend analysis.
4. Reflect on ethical use and limitations of screening metrics (BMI, estimated TDEE).

## 3) System Overview

### Components

* **Tab 1 ‚Äî BMI Calculator:**

  * Inputs: unit system (Metric/Imperial), height, weight, date (`YYYY-MM-DD`).
  * Guardrails: numeric checks, allowed ranges (Height 100‚Äì250 cm, Weight 30‚Äì200 kg, BMI 10‚Äì70), **one record per day**.
  * Output: BMI value + category (Underweight/Normal/Overweight/Obese) and a trend plot with category bands.

* **Tab 2 ‚Äî Metabolic Rate (BMR/TDEE):**

  * Inputs: gender, age (10‚Äì80), activity level; height/weight auto-loaded from a BMI date.
  * Output: BMR (Harris‚ÄìBenedict) and TDEE card; saved per date for linking to the Food Tracker.

* **Tab 3 ‚Äî Food Tracker (Upgraded):**

  * Links to a selected **TDEE date**; **Goal** (Lose ‚àí20%, Maintenance 0%, Gain +15%) sets a daily **target kcal**.
  * Meals: Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner (each with Main/Dessert/Beverage dropdowns).
  * **Custom Food**: add (name, type, kcal); appears instantly in all dropdowns.
  * Outputs: daily summary + progress bar vs target and a **7-day bar chart** with a target line.

### Data Model (Ephemeral, per session)

```python
users = {
  "<username>": {
    "bmi_records": { "YYYY-MM-DD": {"h_cm": float, "w_kg": float, "bmi": float}, ... },
    "tdee_records": { "YYYY-MM-DD": {"bmr": float, "tdee": float, "gender": str, "age": int, ...}, ... },
    "food_log":     { "YYYY-MM-DD": total_kcal_float, ... },
    "foods":        { "MAIN": {...}, "DESSERT": {...}, "BEVERAGE": {...} }
  }
}
SESSION = {"current_user": "<username or None>"}
```

> **Note:** No database is used; all data disappears when the app stops (useful for prototyping).

2. Choose a **Goal** (Lose/Maintenance/Gain) ‚Üí the **target kcal** updates automatically.
3. Pick foods for Breakfast/Lunch/Dinner (Main/Dessert/Beverage).
4. (Optional) Add **Manual extra calories**.
5. Click **‚ûï Log Day Total** to save and view progress vs target + **7-day chart**.
6. Use **‚ôªÔ∏è Reset This Day** to set that day‚Äôs total to 0 or **üßπ Clear Week** to clear all logged days.

## 6) Algorithms & Equations

### **1. Body Mass Index (BMI)**  
**Formula:**  
BMI = weight (kg) / height (m)<sup>2</sup>

**Categories:**  
| Category | BMI Range |  
|:--|:--:|  
| Underweight | &lt; 18.5 |  
| Normal | 18.5 ‚Äì 24.9 |  
| Overweight | 25 ‚Äì 29.9 |  
| Obese | ‚â• 30 |  

*Used to classify body weight relative to height.*

---

### **2. Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR)** ‚Äî _Harris‚ÄìBenedict Equation_  

**Male:**  
BMR = 88.362 + (13.397 √ó W) + (4.799 √ó H) ‚àí (5.677 √ó A)  

**Female:**  
BMR = 447.593 + (9.247 √ó W) + (3.098 √ó H) ‚àí (4.330 √ó A)  

Where:  
- W = weight (kg)  
- H = height (cm)  
- A = age (years)  

*Represents the energy your body burns at rest.*

---

### **3. Total Daily Energy Expenditure (TDEE)**  
**Formula:**  
TDEE = BMR √ó Activity Factor  

**Activity Factors:**  
| Level | Description | Factor |  
|:--|:--|:--:|  
| Sedentary | Little/no exercise | 1.2 |  
| Light | Light exercise 1‚Äì3 days/week | 1.375 |  
| Moderate | Moderate exercise 3‚Äì5 days/week | 1.55 |  
| Active | Hard exercise 6‚Äì7 days/week | 1.725 |  
| Very Active | Physical job or intense training | 1.9 |  

*TDEE reflects total calories burned per day including activity.*

---

### **4. Goal Calorie Targets**  
| Goal | Formula | Description |  
|:--|:--|:--|  
| Lose Weight | 0.80 √ó TDEE | ~20 % calorie deficit |  
| Maintain Weight | 1.00 √ó TDEE | Maintain current body weight |  
| Gain Weight | 1.15 √ó TDEE | ~15 % calorie surplus |  

---

## 7) Data Validation & Guardrails

* **One BMI entry per date** (must clear before overwriting).
* **Numeric checks** for height/weight/age/calories.
* **Range checks** (with confirmation prompt for outliers):

  * Height: 100‚Äì250 cm
  * Weight: 30‚Äì200 kg
  * BMI: 10‚Äì70
  * Age: 10‚Äì80
* **Error/Info toasts** are centered to improve visibility.
  ![Error info](https://github.com/AInfK/EGBI122-Pair-BMI-project-/blob/main/Picture/Popup.png)
* **Food tables** are per-user and include a ‚Äú-‚Äù sentinel choice.

---

## 8) UI/UX Notes
* **Neon ‚Äúgame vibe‚Äù theme** for engagement.
* **BMI plot** includes colored bands for category context.
* **Food 7-day bar chart** displays numeric labels + target line (from TDEE √ó goal).
* **Custom food** entries update all dropdowns immediately to reduce friction.

---

## 9) Testing Performed

* **Functional**:

  * Added/cleared BMI on multiple dates; ensured one entry/day rule works.
  * Verified height/weight conversion between Metric/Imperial.
  * Checked age out-of-range prompts in TDEE tab.
  * Logged food totals with default and custom items; confirmed chart and target updates.

* **Edge cases**:

  * Invalid date strings ‚Üí warning and no save.
  * Negative/NaN calories on custom food ‚Üí rejected.
  * TDEE not available for a date ‚Üí tracker shows target = 0 with guidance.

---

## 10) Limitations

* **Ephemeral storage** (no database): data is lost when the app stops.
* **BMI** is a crude screening tool and does not reflect body composition.
* **TDEE** is an estimate; true energy expenditure varies by individual physiology.
* **Food kcal tables** are approximate; user must confirm values for accuracy.
